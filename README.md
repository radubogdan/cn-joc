I call this [C]entrate [N]ecentrate, but actually this is bulls and cows in terminal mode. It's 
easier to remember what is what if you are thinking at [C]entrate as ```[C]entered``` and [N]ecentrate as ```[N]ot centered```.

In this version, you are trying to guess computer's 4digit number.

Ex:

* Computer number: 1234
* Guess is: 1362
* Answer: 1[C] (number 1) and 2[N] (numbers 2 and 3)

For more information about this game please visit [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows).

PS: I've made this to learn basics in python, if you have complaints about my code please contact /dev/null otherwise you can
write me on my email address.
